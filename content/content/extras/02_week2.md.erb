## 1. Required Preparation.

In order to check your preparation for this course, and to remove speedbumps that might cause you headaches later, we've put together these detailed steps to prepare yourself and your computer for the course. You received an email to this effect last week but here it is one last time: <%= link_to_topic :cosi166b_required_prep %>. 

<%= deliverable "NONE" %>

## 2. Learn Ruby using Ruby The Hard Way

As you know this course is taught in Ruby and Rails. This is not a hard language to learn given your previous experience. There are many ways of learning a language. For us I am assigning this quick and simple sequence of exercises. Once you complete the assignment you will be prepared for what comes next. Locate and begin or continue going through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). Do exercises 1 through 45. Submit the results of Exercise 45 only.

<%= deliverable "Source files for Exercise 45" %>

## 3. First Programming Assignment, first draft

You will be using what you've learned about programming in your previous courses. Yes, it's a new language, but really the basic ideas are exactly the same. We are working on problem solving as much as anything. **Important* I say "first draft" and this means that I would like you to really start looking at this so that it will let you try and apply what you are learning about Ruby. So definitely work on this before lab on Friday so we can answer your questions. This will be due in a week. Here's the detailed explanation: <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>.

<%= deliverable "NONE" %>

## 4. Product Ideas <%= partbadge %>

Come up with a few product ideas. Just think about what you always wanted in the world. Maybe you already have an idea in mind? Anyway, for inspiration you may look at <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %> or anywhere else. It doesn't matter where. Select between one and three that you might want to work on in this class. Remember the caveat: Don't set the bar at "this is the most wonderful product idea I ever saw". Set it at "this is a product that could be interesting to develop and work on."

The assignment is to write up (in 1 or two paragraphs) your favorite product idea(s) and comment on some of the other ideas posted by other students, if you are interested in working on the projects that they wrote up.
