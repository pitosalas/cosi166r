##### Ongoing Work
* **Teams**: Continue working on your projects!

#### Basic Architecture
* User
  * port 80
  * port 443
* Internet
* Server (VM)
  * Port 80
  * Port 443

#### CDN
* A "proxy"
* User
* Internet
* CDN (Content Delivery Network)
  * Cloudflare
  * Secure connections
  * Img, js, CSS
* Server (VM)

#### VM Itself
* Port 443
* Requests come from the Internet
* WWW Server
  * Apache
  * NGINX
* App Server (Rails)
  * Passenger
  * Unicorn
  * Etc
* Database Server
  * Mysql
  * Postgres
  * Etc
* Cache Server
  * Fragment Caching
  * Other Caching
  * Transient
  * e.g. Redis, MemcacheD etc
* Configuration, e.g.
  * 2 virtual CPUs
  * 4gig RAM
  * 40gig SSD
* Advantages and Disadvantages
  * Reasonably cheap
  * Predictable, doesnt go up and down
  * Digital Ocean, AWS, etc.
  * Scaling UP: add memory, CPUs, Disk Space
  * Single point of failure
  * Locks you in to a bad architecture
  * Hard to go to a scaling out
* Scaling Out Obstacle
  * Storing uploaded files on disk
  * All your code assumes files are local
  * If you have a second server, this faiuls

#### Scaling Approach
* Architecture has multiple servers
* "Virtual Private Cloud"
* LB: Load Ballencer
  * Checks for liveness of target servers
  * Sends requests to underlying servers
  * Round robin or more fancy algorithms
* AutoScale Server
  * Decides when additional vms need to be added
* Set of VMs
  * Auto provisioning
  * Auto Scale will detect when a new VM is needed or whenn one fewer is needed
  * App servers (e.g. Rails)
  * Databaser servers (Postgres, MySql, etc)
  * Full Text Search Indexes (e.g. Elastic Search)
  * Caching Sercvers (e.g. Redis)
  * File service (e.g. S3)
