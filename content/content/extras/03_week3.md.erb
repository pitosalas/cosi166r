## 1.Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial \[RORT\]](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) - Chapter 1  <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>

Make sure you look at <%= link_to_topic :railstutorial_notes %> for some critical information, including *how to sign up for a free account!* It's a long chapter but you will learn A LOT! It has lots of useful information that you will use now or refer to in the future. You should do the steps that he shows in the chapter yourself. You will hit snags, but push forward until you get it all done. Now go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

* Can you come up with an original example of when you would use a git branch?
* What is the difference between git and GitHub?
* What is the difference between Heroku and Github?
* What problem does bundler solve?
* Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?

## 2.  [Ruby on Rails Tutorial \[RORT\]](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) Chapter 2. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>

Look at <%= link_to_topic :railstutorial_notes %> for late breaking addenda and errata. This is going to be another exciting chapter. Don't worry if a lot of things seem "magic", as the classes continue it will all become crystal clear to you! For this chapter you are going to create a toy application. Make sure you understand what the app is trying to do and actually follow along. I strongly recommend that you type in the code just like what he says in the book because from my experience you will learn a lot more that way. You will use the `rails` command and the `rake` command as part of your development process. You will for the first time start the process of understanding really how a web server actually works! Take your time and see if you can make it all the way to the end and get it all to work. You will hit snags. Use your resources: the TAs the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

* What is a url and what role does it play in the MVC architecture and the basic operation of a web server?
* What job does a `view` and a `model` do in the MVC architecture?
* Complete this sentence: "Rails is ..."
* The chapter talks about "deploying" the rails application. What do you think that means?
* Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?

## 3. Brainstorm Project Ideas

Meet outside of class for at least 1 hour with 1-2 other students, look through and discuss the project options. You may use some of the ideas you wrote up on Tuesday, or again refer to all these sources: <%= link_to_topic :product_inspirations %>.

These are not necessarily going to be your teammates. It's just a forum to immerse yourself in the project ideas and exchange ideas. Discuss discuss discuss. I know it's hard to find time, but really try to do it so you can really get a feel of where you could take each idea. Write up your favorite two or three ideas as separate entries in the [Product Ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1571070) in Latte.  It doesn't matter if the others in your team of three write up the same. However write them down independently!

**Deliverable**: Write up your personal favorite 2-3 ideas as [separate posts in the product ideas list in latte](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1571070). Also, comment on one or two other students project ideas there.

## 4. Complete Movies_1  <%= zipbadge %> 

Complete <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. <%= deliverable "Zipped up source code for your solution." %>

Begin working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_2 %>. This ruby project builds on <%= link_to_topic :pa_movies_1 %>. Using the same data set now you will augment your statistics and predictive logic, and finally test how well your algorithm can predict what a certain user will like to see.

<%= callout("NB", " Don't get too carried away with a very clever predictive algorithm. Previous students have found that a super simplistic algorithm (at least in this assignment) works almost as well as the fanciest one you can come up with.") %>
