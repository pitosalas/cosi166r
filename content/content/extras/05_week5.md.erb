## 1. Develop an initial schema for your product.

Read [Basics of good database design in Web Development](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/03/17/the-basics-of-good-database-design-in-web-development/). You might google around for other sources if you like. You need to think clearly about the functionality that your system will support. You also need to think carefully about relationships.

For example, let's say I have a Student entity and I have a Course entity. Is there exactly one student for every course (1 to 1). Are there many students for any one course (many to 1) or perhaps does one student have many courses (1 to many), or maybe even a combination - one student can have many courses, and one course can have many students - (many to many). Don't even start worrying about designing your database until you have questions like that clear in your mind!

Using all that background, develop initial schema for your product. Each team member work separately so you can then compare and contrast what you came up with. So this is an individual assignment! Include table names, field or attribute names, and relations or joins. **Please use this exact format: <%= link_to_topic :simple_schema_notation %>**

<%= deliverable "Initial schema for your product. As a pdf file generated any way you want. Use the required format!! Include your name and hw number!" %>

## 2. Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning##cha-beginning) Ch 4, "Rails Flavored Ruby". <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>

This is an easier chapter, reviewing a variety of Ruby topics that are extended in Rails. This is possible by the way because Ruby as a programming language is very extensible, and Rails takes advantage of this. It has not been unusual to notice features invented by the Rails team which over time get moved into Ruby core. This chapter is an excellent review of Ruby as well. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

* Give me your explanation of what a symbol is in Ruby. Write a very brief few lines of Ruby to illustrate.
* What is meant by the idea that Ruby classes can be "opened up" or "reopened"?
* What is the difference between 'require' and 'require_relative' in Ruby?
* Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?

<%= deliverable "Submit your response as a pdf file including your name at the top of the file" %>

## 3. Complete Team Project Stage 1 <%= pdfbadge %> <%= teambadge %>

* Complete and submit the deliverables for: <%= link_to_topic :hw_166_project_stage1 %>

## 4. **PA Rails 1:** Complete work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. <%= zipbadge %>

**DUE DATE EXTENDED TO MARCH 4 2021 - NO EXTENSIONS WILL BE GRANTED**

Submit your code as a zip file. You may want to begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>.

<%= deliverable "As detailed in Rails 1 instructions." %>
