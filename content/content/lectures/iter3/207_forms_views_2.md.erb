1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **RORT:** Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#cha-beginning) Chapter 8, "Basic Login". This chapter covers routes, controllers and actions, reviewing what was demoed in class last week. You will encounter the vaunted `form_for` again. Notice that `form_for` and `form_tag` are still supported but as of Rails 5.1, there's a new `form_with` which will replace both eventually. And you will see for the first time in this tutorial, the routes "resources" line. You will finally deploy what you have so far onto Heroku.

    As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

    * What does it mean when we say that the HTTP protocol is "stateless." Why does this pose a challenge for processing authentication?
    * The `log_in` method has this line: `session[:user_id] = user.id`. Explain it.
    * How is a logout achieved?
    * Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading? <%= deliverable "Submit your asnwers as a pdf to latte." %>
 
##### Ongoing Work
1. **Teams**: Continue working on your projects! 

##### Optional, very useful reading
* [Modern Javacript CheatSheet](https://github.com/mbeaudru/modern-js-cheatsheet)
* [Javascript Coding Conventions](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)
* [Service Objects Explained](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/service-objects-explained-simply-for-ruby-on-rails-5-a8cc42a5441f)
* [Routes In Ruby on Rails](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/routes-in-ruby-on-rails-5-using-resources-and-records-to-define-urls-411a68afa21a)
* [Example Code with one form based on two models](https://github.com/pitosalas/rails52_basic_form_demo)

#### Today
* We're all on Zoom! Where are you in the world?
* Is this time slot workable for you or not? Do you have connectivity? Lecture? Lab?
* For homeworks that are we due or are due on 3/10, 3/12, 3/17 and 3/19 there will be no deadlines
* How do you want to conduct the course going forward?

#### Review Basics
* Why form handling typically requite 2 HTTP requests, two actions, two views
* Partial views and rendering
* Each of the actions in a simple case, e.g. categories_controller
* Before-action, and setting up of the 'common parameters'
* "Strong parameters"

##### Forms that come from more than one model
* Look at an example: [Rails52 Forms Demo](https://github.com/pitosalas/rails52_basic_form_demo)
  * URL
  * controller
  * View

##### Review: Context setting
* URLs have 0 to n "parameters"
* Helpers must include them too
* Actions must set them up
* Look at comments_controller
* Look at form_with in this case

##### Context setting beyond the ids
* Anything you will need in the view, you should set up in the action
* Look at ItemsController#edit and how it sets up @categories and @category
* Look at views/items/_form and how it uses those

##### Where should code go?
* This can be more confusing than you think
* Remember: as little code in the view as possible
* Remember 2: as liitle code in the controller as possible
* So, where then? models and other non-rails classes (POROs)
* Best is when you write code with NO rails dependency! (odd, right?)
* Improves testability, modularity and reusability!
* models should contain any code
  * Legitimately is related to just the 'persisted data'
  * Confusing when you need a method that touches two models

##### Respect your database!
* Notice how many calls to the database are needed to display a page
* Bad sign: O(n) database calls, where n = number of rows displayed
* More sophisticated ActiveRecord techniques to have one call do more work
* Let's take a look at the home page


#### Look at next class
* Look at homework <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
