### Breakout (30 minutes)

* Everyone on their own, look through *all* the [product ideas](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1571070) and post a comment or two
* Which one are you impressed with? How happy are you with the ones your team came up with? What new ideas come to mind
* If you want to modify what you've posted (no deleting) or add something new, that's fine!
* Each team prepare to give a 1 to 2 minute presentation on what idea you are going for!

## That's all for today!
