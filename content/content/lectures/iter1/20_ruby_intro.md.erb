## Product Brainstorm 30 minutes

* Random groups of 3-5 students in class - 30 minutes
  * Get to know each other a little. Introduce yourselves
  * Each student, in turn describes the product that they proposed
  * Discuss your favorite product that you proposed or some other student proposed
  * Prepare to explain it to the class in about 1 minute, so not a lot of detail
  * Each group presents one product

## Projects and teams

* Projects are at the core of this course, working in teams of 3 or 4
* Each team will be building a product! We will help you find one!
* We will be discussing how to work most effectively in a team, with some conceptual and some practical insights
* Teams will be formed in collaboration with the students.

<slide_break></slide_break>

* You will start meeting together even before there are official team deliverables
* No one "owns" the idea or the project. J
* Just because you proposed it doesn't mean that another team can't use it too; and just because you proposed it doesn't mean that your teammates have to let you make all the decisions
* Here's a [quick survey](https://forms.gle/LK6joH9643a5JJJe9) to collect information regarding your team preferences: https://forms.gle/LK6joH9643a5JJJe9
