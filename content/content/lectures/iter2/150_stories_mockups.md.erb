##### Ongoing work
* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 2** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>

#### Discussions
* How did you read Chapter 5?
* <%= link_to_topic :mini_scrum %>
* Why use Postgres versus other dbs?
* Post it note exercise

<%= include_topic :user_stories %>
<%= include_topic :mockups_prototypes %>
<%= include_topic :ux_flows %>
<%= include_topic :pitos_rules_of_ux %>
