<%= homework_hdr %>

1. <%= pdfbadge %> **Paper Prototype**: Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/). Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an inidividual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome. <%= deliverable "Readable image of your paper prototype. If you just take a cell phone picture of a drawing in pencil (worst case) it will not be legible." %>
1. <%= zipbadge %> **PA Rails 1:** Complete work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>. Submit your code as a zip file. <%= deliverable "Rails app as a zip file." %> Begin work on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>.
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= teambadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Weekly Team Update:** Submit your <%= link_to_topic :weekly_progress_updates %> according to the instructions. <%= team_deliverable "Weekly Progress Update" %>

##### Ongoing work
* **Project teams:** Although there are no specific deliverables, you should be following <%= link_to_section :intro, :project_roadmap %>. Not just during lab and during your meetings, but on your own. Remember with a team of four (or 3 or 5) students, that's a lot of horsepower, and so we have high expectations. The sooner you kick into gear the better!
* **Rails PA 2** Working on <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_2 %>. You can see the assigment and due dates here: <%= link_to_topic  :pa_rails_guide %>
