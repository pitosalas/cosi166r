:slide_title 1. Proper branching process: [Gitflow Branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

:image :gitflow

* `main` Branch is deployed to production
* `development` branch is the one we work on
* `feature` branches are created from `development` and merged back into it
* Important: feature branches should not last longer than a week or so

:slide_title 2. Automated testing

:image :testing_pyramid

* You will have more tests from the bottom than from the top
* Tests near the top later as your functionality stabilizes
* In order to write a test you must **know what is correct behavior**
* Have a single command which runs all the tests and any individual or subset
* Depending on your setup you can usually find a UI to do it

:slide_title Test Data

* Called "test fixtures"
* Are generally created on the fly for each test
* They should be fast to create and tear down
* Option 1: Rails Fixtures
* Option 2: On the fly coding in test setup
* Option 3: Fixture factory
* Look at code...





* Version control
* Automated Tests and Suites
* Continuous Integration
* Deployment automation
* Continuous delivery
