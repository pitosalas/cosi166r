:slide_title In class GRAND DEMOS!

### Purpose

It will help you prepare for the final presentations to have kind of a dry run in class. And as you go into the world to use your Software Engineering skills, you will find that practice makes perfect when it comes to demoing your projects!

### How it will work

Each team will get 5 minutes to present, with 1 minute for one of their peers to ask a question. Each team is hard capped at 5 minutes.

The TA will act as a timekeeper, giving you a 3, 2, and 1 minute visual que and will stop you mid sentence if you go over as we have 11 teams total.

This is not a formal presentation so you don't need slides or introductions (but if you want to it's ok)

You should introduce your app and give us a quick demo. Show us the cool stuff. You donâ€™t need to show us everything!

We will be presenting in team order. Team 1 will go first, followed by Team 2, and so on so forth.

All members of the team are expected to be in the final class. This is your final presentation. No exceptions will be made.

### Evaluation

We will evaluate your presentation as "participation", meaning, if you show up show that you put effort in preparing you will get an automatic 95. We expect there to be bugs and crashes.


:slide_title Details on final deliverables for the course

* Here are the details of what the deliverables should contain (by the showcase): :topic_link :hw_166_final_deliverables
* All deliverables due on the last day of class
* Between that time and when you demo you can submit a "delta" . 
* So if you fixed a bug, got something to work that wasn't, or cleaned up some code or text we will accept a supplementary submission IF you declare it officially.
* We will look at your github commit log and will not consider undeclared or excessive changes. If you just modify your Github, we will notice and not consider the update.
* To declare your changes you need to send an email to Pito with a cover note explaining the changes and the file names and a link to what was changed and if appropriate and required we will adjust the grade.

:slide_bigtitle THANKS
