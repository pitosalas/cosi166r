:slide_title In class GRAND DEMOS!

* Each team will get 4 minutes to present, with 1 minute for one of their peers to ask a question. Each team is hardcapped at 5 minutes. 
* The TA will act as a timekeeper, giving you a 3, 2, and 1 minute visual que and will stop you mid sentence if you go over as we have 11 teams total.
* This is not a formal presentation with a slide deck and introductions of the team needed.
* You should introduce your app and give us a quick demo. Show us the cool stuff. You donâ€™t need to show us everything!
* We will be presenting in team order. Team 1 will go first, followed by Team 2, and so on so forth.
* All members of the team are expected to be in the final class. This is your final presentation. No exceptions will be made.
