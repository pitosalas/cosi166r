* Checkin Questions

:slide_title Javascript Frameworks & Libraries

:slide_subtitle Single Page Web Applications (SPAs) vs. Traditional Applications

* Examples of SPAs you've probably heard of: React, Angular, Vue... many more
* Javascript is the lifeblood of many of these SPAs - you can not escape Javascript

:slide_subtitle How do they work?

* Rather than call a controller/action to render some HTML, it renders HTML through one element.
* Client side rendering - a single HTML file for an entire app?
* Disadvantages - not great for SEO, slower page download speeds

:slide_title Stimulus.js and how it can help you!

* Stimulus JS - a Javascript library meant to augment (but not take over) your HTML
* Create Javascript controllers/actions, listen for changes, update
* [A basic demo](https://github.com/pitosalas/public_samples/tree/master/rails/stimulus_demo)

:slide_title Other shiny new tools

* Hotwire - allows you to divide pages into components, and stream partial page updates using websockets
* Stimulus Reflex - Much less new, alternative to SPAs, allows you to listen to changes streamed via CableReady (websockets) and more the application state
    * [Stimulus Reflex Demos](http://expo.stimulusreflex.com/)

:slide_title A friendly warning!
* Do not invest in a framework unless you can list all of its use cases/applicability/disadvantages to your application
* Lots of different frameworks do the same thing but in different ways, each with different advantages/disadvantages
