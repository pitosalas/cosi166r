:h2 1. Read these three articles about user interface design

We're not all going to be visual artists or graphic designers. But there are some really basic guidelines and rules of thumb that will get decent results for everyone. Even for people who think of themselves as "engineers" or even just interested in the "back end", a degree of basic proficiency in visual design is part of your toolkit. Please read these articles, and give them some thought. What did you learn? What did you disagree with? What would you add? Do you have another, better reference? Come up with one or two ways in which you can use these ideas to improve your product.

* [Clean Up Your Visual Mess](http://www.visualmess.com)
* [Principles of User Interface Design](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/)
* [Design Principles: Hierarchy](http://www.toptal.com/designers/visual/design-principles-hierarchy)

:h2 3. Paper Prototyping <%= pdfbadge %>

* Read this paper about [Paper Prototyping](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/paperprototyping/)
* Design a paper prototype for your team's product.  Remember, this is an individual assignment, so that we can compare each team member's vision of what the product might be. We will assess your work based on the care and thought you put into it, not on whether the UI itself is awesome.

:h2 DONE Read [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Chapter 6](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning##cha-beginning) <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>

Here we see are learning how to create validations for models. As usual I really encourage and ask you to go through the code samples and actually type them in. You will see that it really helps your understanding and will assure your success in this course! Use your resources: the TAs, the class mailing list, stack overflow, google and push through to success! When you are done, go to Latte and answer these warmup questions:

* Give me your explanation for what `validates :name, presence: true` does in the User model.
* What is TDD? When and why might you use it?
* What is a hash function, and why should you hash passwords/other forms of confidential data in your database?
* Are there one or two things you are still confused by? If not, what one or two things were the most memorable about your reading?

:deliverable Submit your answers as a pdf to latte.
