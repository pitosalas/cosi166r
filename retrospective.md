## Notes from experience teaching in Spring 2017

* add a significant new amount of javascript
* space out the PARails 1,2,3 so that they match better with the material
* look closely at balancing of homeworks so that they don't clump together
* look closely at adding justifications to homework assignments
* add a little more and structured stuff about agile
* make sure the cocktail hour is there
* Maybe ask Jen Cleary to do some kind of teaming workshop during one of the early classes


* Here are two examples of lectures with too many and too confusing assignments:

## Notes from Fall 2017
* At the beginning of the semester show off some past project demos
* Move more part only work to end because thats when they are most busy
* Assignment: make sure you don't ask for something youve not covered yet.
* Beware of last minute homework changes. Post to Latte no less than 1 week before
* Make sure you dont put API key into github
* Practice on how to learn things
  * Start early to be able to ask questions
  * Google it
  * Use Stack Overflow
  * Youtube videos
  * Tutorials
* Start planning early
* Like the lab period
* Shared google calendar requiring teams to sign up for a block of time
* Have a student come to class early to describe what the process and course was Like
* Share the starting and ending code of live coding in a github account
* Mention that i can help finding rooms to meet
* 2 TWO: Hartl chapters a week, but dont start coding the group projects yet
* Two DB homeworks too close together, and maybe first one be participation
* PRs were not giving suggestions that were that useful
* Give the PRs a more clear charter and explain expectations to both students and PRs
* Maybe tell them to meet only twice: give a demo to the PR and get them feedback

## Notes from Fall 2018
* React on Rails - Javascript
* PA2 and Pa3 Rails - Assignments were a little early
* Maybe move the brainstorming a little bit later.
* RORT Chapters vis a vis Rails. 
* Demonstrate techniques in class, e.g. ajax
* DOnt ask RTHW submission. Just make it participation. 
* Have an easy baseline ruby quiz by lecture 3
* Perhaps insread of quiz have a equivalent complexity to the lesson 45 assignment
* Fewer requests for students to brainstorm products
* Less time on brainstorming product 
* Pre-work: try to get them thinking about new products before first day of class
* Use the lab time at the start of the course 
* Cosnider ditching PA Rails 3. Show the solution to it later during lecture on JS
* Analyze a well written Rails App
* Practicum on RoR Web development.
* Get rid of premature requesst to design prod db
*  

## Notes from Spring 2020
* Change "TA Partner" to "Client TA" and working with TA something graded

+ Labs 2x
+ Homework is good practice

- A lot more homework than other classes; homework and readings in the class is a little bit too much; too many readings without enough practice; 5x
- More help on how "project should work"; Learn how to divide a project into smaller parts for different team members; Maybe lead class through finishing a project from scratch before the team projects 3x
- Sometimes latte is out of date; Sync of course with book; Some ordering of material is wrong; sometimes you over material in class before giving the homework; some of the readings are not even covered in class 7x
- TA Grading seems inconsistent (or rubric is not exact or detailed enough); Dont like when TA is too critical 4x
- Work I ask for during class is too rushed; pace of instruction is too fast; teaching feels like a dump on me; too much; 3x

- RORT jumps around too much
- Include more about the front end and styling; Would like to learn more css/bootstrap 4x

- Compare Rails to other frameworks; Allow us to work in other languages 2x
- Would like to see more demos, would like to see more examples, would like to learn more best practices
- Would like more TA office hours; TA avaia
- Course should be 6 credits at least
- Lab session is too long; would prefer 3 smaller lab sessions
